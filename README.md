How to Play:
-Click a bubble, and if there are adjacent bubbles with the same color, the game will automatically select all the adjacent, same-colored bubbles.
-Click anywhere in the select again to remove bubbles
-Click any other bubbles outside the selection to cancel selection

The Goal:
-Clear all bubbles until there are no more adjacent, same-colored bubbles.
-Get the highest score possible! The score you would add to your total if you were to remove the selected bubbles is given at the bottom-left of the board. The total score is shown to the bottom-right of the board
